# sleep-rnn
Master's thesis research code for automatic detection of sleep events using deep recurrent neural network (very messy since it includes all my experiments, prefer the cleaner Sleep-EEG-Event-Detector repo).

The branch `rc1.2` is likely the most relevant (it includes my last experiments and many of my last changes).
