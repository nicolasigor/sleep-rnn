# sleep-rnn
Master's thesis research code for automatic detection of sleep events using deep recurrent neural network. 

Very messy since it includes all my experiments and explored models, and it was mainly written for my own research purposes. Prefer the cleaner [Sleep-EEG-Event-Detector](https://github.com/nicolasigor/Sleep-EEG-Event-Detector) repository (which is intended for publication).

The branch `rc1.2` is likely the most relevant (it includes my last experiments and many of my last changes).
